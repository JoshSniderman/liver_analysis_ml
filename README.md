# Liver Disease Predictor

## Introduction

Liver cirrhosis affects nearly 80 million to 100 million Americans but remains widely misdiagnosed. There are many contributing factors to why, one of the main factors being that it can occur in even the healthiest of individuals. With symptoms that are similar to other illnesses it becomes that much difficult to properly diagnose. The medical community has started making progress in terms of diagnoses but the issue of misdiagnosis still remains. With the disease being so widespread, the number of healthy livers decreases which affects organ donation as well. Our team decided to tackle that problem by creating a tool for doctors to possibly catch liver cirrhosis early on before sending patients through extensive tests and treatments.

## About Data:

We based our results on the 4 stages of liver disease:

Stage 1 – Few Septa (Fatty Liver Disease)
           This is when there is fat accumulation in the liver without inflammation. It can be harmless and usually asymptomatic.
           
Stage 2 – Many Septa (NASH Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis)
           A more aggressive form of liver disease in which the inflammation and scarring starts. This is often referred as a silent killer because it can lead to permanent liver damage and scarring, which could prevent the liver from functioning properly.
           
Stage 3 – Portal Fibrosis (NASH with Fibrosis)
           This stage is when scarring around liver cells are caused by the continuous inflammation. The liver can still function somewhat normally at this point.
           
Stage 4 – Cirrhosis
           The most severe of the stages that causes permanent liver damage. The liver either enlarges or shrinks, scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the liver stops functioning properly. Cirrhosis can be fatal and can turn into cancer or requires a transplant.

The dataset was used to build a Deep Learning model. After identifying key attributes from a patient test results the model should be able to predict which type of liver disease the patient has.

## Problem Statement:
Build a deep learning model to predict the type of a liver disease based on the patient’s attributes like Age, BMI, WBC, RBC etc.

WBC vs RBC:

ALT vs AST:

Plat vs HGB:

## Train Deep Learning Model:
Train deep learning models based on different nodes configuration using library Keras Tensforflow. Model building would have following:
Exploratory Data Analysis using visualizations in pandas, matplotlb and seaborn

## Cleaning the data
Preprocessing of data using scikit learn library
Creating dummy (one-hot encoding) variables
Scaling the continuous variables
Train the model using Training dataset
Evaluation of model (check accuracy & error) using Test dataset
Save the best fit model

## Deploy the trained model on Heroku:
Deploy the trained model using flask application in python which would have the following:
A front-end interface for the user to interact and provide the input to required attributes
Execute the model in backend and the output of predicted liver disease type
